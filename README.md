## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of a bank marketing campaign dataset to predict client subscriptions to term deposits. The dataset, comprising 41,188 records and 20 features, was analyzed to identify key drivers of subscription decisions, develop predictive models, and provide actionable business recommendations.

### 1.1 Key Findings and Recommendations
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) revealed that call duration, prior campaign success, and economic conditions significantly influence subscription likelihood. Feature engineering introduced five new features, such as `duration_per_campaign` and `prev_success`, enhancing predictive power. Four supervised learning models—Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest—were trained and evaluated. Random Forest achieved the highest performance with an F1-score of 0.62 and AUC-ROC of 0.89, excelling in handling the imbalanced dataset (11% positive class).

**Primary Recommendation:** Deploy the Random Forest model for campaign optimization, achieving a 50% F1-score while maintaining interpretability through feature importance analysis.

### 1.2 Best Model Performance
The Random Forest model outperformed others due to its robustness to non-linear relationships and class imbalance. It achieved:

**Table 1: Random Forest Model Performance**  
| Metric | Value |  
|--------|-------|  
| F1-Score | 0.62 |  
| AUC-ROC | 0.89 |  
| Confidence Interval (F1-Score) | 0.62 ± 0.03 |  

Cross-validation confirmed stable performance, with a 95% confidence interval for F1-score of 0.62 ± 0.03.

### 1.3 Business Implications
The analysis suggests targeting clients with prior successful interactions and focusing on longer calls to maximize subscriptions. Economic conditions, captured by `econ_stability`, should guide campaign timing. Recommendations include prioritizing middle-aged and senior clients and developing proxy features for call duration to enable pre-call targeting.

## 2. Data Analysis

### 2.1 Dataset Description and Quality Assessment
The dataset contains 41,188 records of bank marketing campaign interactions, with 20 features (10 numerical, 10 categorical) and a binary target (`y`: ‘yes’ or ‘no’ for term deposit subscription). Numerical features include `age`, `duration`, and economic indicators like `emp.var.rate`. Categorical features include `job`, `marital`, and `poutcome`. The target is imbalanced, with 11% ‘yes’ responses.

#### 2.1.1 Short Dataset Overview
**Table 2: Dataset Overview**  
| Attribute | Description |  
|-----------|-------------|  
| Records | 41,188 |  
| Features | 20 (10 numerical, 10 categorical) |  
| Target | Binary (`yes`/`no`, 11% `yes`) |  

#### 2.1.2 Data Quality Assessment
**Table 3: Quality Assessment Identified**  
| Issue | Resolution |  
|-------|------------|  
| Class Imbalance | Used F1-score instead of accuracy |  
| Unknown Categories | Preserved as meaningful indicators |  
| High-Cardinality Features | Targeted encoding strategies |  

#### 2.1.2 Feature Categories
**Table 4: Feature Categories**  
| Category | Examples |  
|----------|---------|  
| Numerical | `age`, `duration`, `emp.var.rate` |  
| Categorical | `job`, `marital`, `poutcome` |  

#### 2.1.3 Data Quality Issues and Resolutions
- Class imbalance addressed through appropriate metric selection (F1-score rather than accuracy).
- Unknown categories preserved as meaningful indicators of data availability.
- High-cardinality features handled through targeted encoding strategies.

### 2.2 Preprocessing Decisions
Preprocessing involved:
- Handling ‘unknown’ values as missing, imputed with median for numerical and mode or target encoding for categorical features.
- **Encoding:** One-hot encoding for low-cardinality variables (`marital`, `contact`), label encoding for ordinal `education`, and target encoding for high-cardinality `job` and `month_day`.
- **Scaling:** RobustScaler for numerical features to mitigate outlier effects, preserving distribution shapes.

#### 2.2.1 Data Splitting Strategy
**Table 5: Data Splitting Strategy**  
| Split | Percentage |  
|-------|------------|  
| Train | 70% |  
| Validation | 15% |  
| Test | 15% |  

#### 2.2.1 Encoding Approach
```python
encoding_strategy = {
    'Low Cardinality (<10 categories)': 'One-Hot Encoding',
    'High Cardinality (>10 categories)': 'Target Encoding with Smoothing',
    'Ordinal Relationships': 'Manual Ordinal Encoding'
}
```

#### 2.2.2 Feature Scaling
StandardScaler selected for optimal performance across algorithms, robust to outliers while maintaining interpretability, and consistent with linear model assumptions where applicable.

These decisions ensured robust data preparation, addressing missingness and outliers while maintaining feature interpretability.

### 2.3 Feature Engineering Insights

#### 2.3.1 Domain-Driven Feature Creation
**Table 6: Domain-Driven Feature Creation**  
| Feature | Description |  
|---------|-------------|  
| `duration_per_campaign` | Call duration divided by campaign count |  
| `prev_success` | Indicator of prior campaign success |  
| *Others* | Three additional engineered features |  

#### 2.3.2 Feature Importance Findings
**Table 7: Importance Findings**  
| Feature | Importance |  
|---------|------------|  
| `duration_per_campaign` | High |  
| `prev_success` | High |  

Analysis showed `duration_per_campaign` and `prev_success` strongly correlated with `y`, enhancing model performance.
